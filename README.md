Importing Necessary Libraries:

We import SecureRandom from the java.security package. SecureRandom is a cryptographic random number generator.
Defining the Main Class:

We define a class named Main, which serves as the entry point of our program.
Main Method:

Generating Password:

We have a method named generatePassword, which takes an integer parameter length indicating the desired length of the password to be generated.
Inside this method, we initialize a StringBuilder named password to construct the generated password.
We create an instance of SecureRandom named random to generate random numbers securely.
We define four strings: upper, lower, digits, and special, which contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, respectively.
We concatenate all these strings into allCharacters, which contains all the characters from which we will generate the password.
Using a loop, we generate length number of random characters from allCharacters and append them to the password string.
Finally, we return the generated password as a string.
Printing the Generated Password:

In the main method, we call the generatePassword method with the argument 12, indicating that we want to generate a password of length 12.
We print the generated password to the console.
